        Comments are basically "lines" in a source code that are always ignored by the compiler (like my whishes gets ignored by my fam)
        The most general motion/use of comments is to make the programmer understand "what", "how" and "why" of the specific parts of the program

        C++ offers two types of comments:
                                        1. Single line comments(//)
                                        2. Multi  line comments(/** /)

    */

    // this is a single line comment
    // use this comment in the times when explaining why a statement is doing "something"
    // like set x=0  (explain why we are setting x=0)

    // we will likely not be telling why the variable, function or anything else is doing what it is doing
    // instead we will define what the variable, function, etc will be doing

    /*
         This is a multi line comment is basically used when we gotta comment out a large number of lines
         NOTE: multiline comments cannot be nested however we can use single line comments inside a multiline comment
         // ex
