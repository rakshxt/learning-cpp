/*
    object is a memory location or it can be thought of as a region in a memory(likely to be RAM)
    an object is used to store and retrive values from the memory
    pros: rather than to recall the memory address, we just needa call the object to retrive the value that we desire

    a named object (an object with and identifier(name)) is called a variable
*/

int main(){
    // creating a variable named "x" that will be getting some "memory address" in my RAM(like 140)
    // then everytime it is reffered or called in the program, compiler will retrive value from the memory location(140)

    int x; // instantiation/definition/(defining a variable)

    // during compilation, an object will be instantiated (process-instantiation) and given some memory region and then value stored in the region will be called everytime we call the object/variable
